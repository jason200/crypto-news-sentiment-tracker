## ðŸ§­ Overview

This project implements a lightweight **information retrieval and sentiment analysis pipeline** designed to study public sentiment trends across cryptocurrency-related news headlines and correlate them with actual market behavior.

The system combines:
- **Pyserini BM25** â€” for text-based retrieval from a corpus of crypto news headlines  
- **TextBlob** â€” for sentiment polarity scoring (â€“1 = negative, +1 = positive)  
- **Matplotlib** â€” for visualization of sentiment histograms and time-based trend overlays  
- **Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)** â€” for fetching historical BTC/USD and ETH/USD prices  

All computations run efficiently on CPU hardware, making this system fully reproducible in standard academic environments.
